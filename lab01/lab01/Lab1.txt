CS 161 Pre-Requisite Programming Assignment Introduction: The goal of this assignment is to ensure that you can create, edit, and execute C++ programs. Students in CS 250 will be required to create several programs that address various course topics.Submission: You should submit a single source code file named main.cpp that contains all of the C++ code required to complete this assignment. Do not submit any executable files, any Visual Studio project files, or any data files. Your dropbox should contain nothing except the main.cpp file.Instructions: Create a standard C++ program that prompts the user for the full path name of an input text file. The program should open the input text file, make a list of all words contained in the file, close the file, and then display the list of words found in the file to standard output. The list should be displayed in alphabetical (ASCII) order, and each word should appear no more than one time in the list (i.e. eliminate duplicate entries). There will be no more than 100 unique words in the input file.Your program must be written in standard C++ 11 or later, and must compile and execute on Windows, Linux, and OS X (in other words, do not include any system-dependent statements in your code). Note that a "word" in C++ is merely a sequence of non-whitespace characters separated by whitespace, so don't worry about identifying English words. The C++ stream extraction operator (>>) isolates words by default, and is the easiest way to read a word from a file.See the attached file for a sample output. (Note: The output is not exactly alphabetical as uppercase letters will appear before any lower case letters regardless of their place in the alphabet.)

For lab 3, write a program to decode a message using public key cryptography 
based on the RSA cipher.  You can use the code you wrote last week to calculate 
the residues.  

The input  will be a list of 1, 2 or 3 digit numbers with spaces in between.  
Each number will correspond to a letter.  Words will be separated by a code for 
a "space".   The list may contain up to 100 numbers.  

Your program should prompt the user for the name of a file which will contain 
the encrypted message. (If you took CS250 last semester, you should have a 
routine in the pre-req lab for opening and reading a file.  )

The output of this program will be the decrypted message.  Decrypt the message 
using formula 8.4.6 on page 491.  I will provide the appropriate parameters 
when the time comes.

In the decoded message 1 will correspond to A, 2 to B, 3 to C etc.  I  will use 
the number 27 to correspond to a space between words.

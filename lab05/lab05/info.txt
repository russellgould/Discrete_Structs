Your task is to create a program that implements the division algorithm 
(algorithm 4.8.1, page 219 of the textbook) and the Euclidean algorithm 
(algorithm 4.8.2, page 224 of the textbook) and accepts positive integer input 
between 1 and 2^63-1, i.e. the "long long" data type.  You should submit a 
single source code file named main.cpp that contains all of the C++ code 
required to complete this assignment.

Instructions: Given two integers x and y with the requirements that 
1 <= x <= 2^63 AND 1 <= y < x, Create a C++ program that prompts the user for 
the two values, and then displays the following: The greatest common divisor 
of x and y, i.e. gcd(x,y), calculated using the Euclidean algorithm (4.8.2) 
The quotient q and remainder r that satisfy the equation x = yq + r, calculated 
using the Division algorithm (4.8.1). Note that 0 = r < y by the definition of 
"remainder".

Your code must implement and use the algorithms given in the textbook. You may 
use functions provided by System::Numerics or GNU GMP to test and verify your 
answers, but the algorithms must be implemented and used in your code, and not 
have your program simply call a built-in library function to get the answer.

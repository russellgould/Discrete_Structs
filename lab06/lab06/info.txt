Write a C++ program that implements Algorithm 5.1.1 page 241 using the steps 
and data structures shown. 

Use the division algorithm shown in Epp, rather than integer or division 
operators in C++.  You can use the code from last week for the division 
algorithm.  

Write the code to prompt the user for a decimal number and print out the 
binary result.  The program should be set up to repeat the process 5 times, 
so I can test it with 5 different decimal numbers without having to restart 
it each time.

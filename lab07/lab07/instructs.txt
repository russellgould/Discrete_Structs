This program will generate the solution to a second order linear homogeneous 
recurrence relation with constant coefficients.   In other words, the program 
will find the solution to a recurrence relation that looks like:  

ak = Aak-1 + Bak-2  with initial conditions a0 and a1.  

Your program should prompt the user to input values for A, B, a0 and a1.  
(These values do not have to be integers.)  The program should handle the case 
of distinct real roots and the case of a single real root for the 
characteristic equation.  In the case of complex roots, the program should 
alert the user to that situation and terminate.  The program should print the 
formula for the sequence and the first 6 terms of the sequence.

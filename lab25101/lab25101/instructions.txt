Instructions
 
This assignment focuses on basic set operations in C++.  Your submission should 
consist of a single C++ source code file named main.cpp.  Your program must 
compile and execute on the PCC linux environment used for this class.

Instructions

Write a C++ program that does the following:

Accept a list of elements on a single line (separated by spaces).  The elements 
are strings (with no embedded spaces).This is set A.

Accept a second list of elements on a single line (separated by spaces). The 
elements are strings (with no embedded spaces). This is set B.

Sets A and B will contain no more than 200 elements each.

Display each of the following:
  The cardinality and roster of the intersection of A and B
  The cardinality and roster of the union of A and B
  The cardinality and roster of the relative complement of A and B (i.e. A - B)
  The cardinality and roster of the relative complement of B and A (i.e. B - A)
  The cardinality and roster of the cross product of A and B
  The cardinality of the power set of the cross product of A and B (just the 
    cardinality, not the roster).

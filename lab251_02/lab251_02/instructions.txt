In this lab, use the technique on page 485 to calculate the residue of an 
integer of the form a^n.  Your program should prompt the user for a, and n and 
the modulus.  Your program will then print out the residue.  The program 
should loop through 4 times so that I can test it with 4 different values of 
a, n and modulus.  You must use the technique on page 485 for this program.  
Use the long long type for intermediate results since raising even small 
numbers to powers can result in very large numbers.

You will need to have a decimal to binary conversion to implement the algorithm 
If you took CS250 last quarter, you can copy that piece of code into your 
program. 

I recommend that you first write a function to calculate residues for power of 
2.  You can then use this function to determine the residues for numbers that 
are not powers of 2.  

You can test your code for small numbers and exponents using the C++ modulo 
(%) but for larger numbers you will not get correct answers as the numbers 
will be too big.  Use the examples in the book to check your code for larger 
numbers.  (p485, 492)

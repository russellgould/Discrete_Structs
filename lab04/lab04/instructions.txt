In this lab you will find the prime factors of any integer. Your program 
should accept an integer and first determine if it is prime.

If it is prime you should report that. If it is not prime, the program should 
list all the prime factors. Some prime factors may be listed more than once, 
if appropriate.  

For example, if the number 45 is input, the program should list the prime 
factors as 3, 3, 5. You will have 2 weeks to complete this program.
